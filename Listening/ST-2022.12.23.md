Is Elizabeth Olsen **left-handed**? No, but thank you for thinking I'm one of those gifted, more creative people. Does Elizabeth Olsen have an accent? I guess it depneds on **where you're from**. I think we all have accents. I think that's what happens when people **live** in different parts of the world we all sound different.
